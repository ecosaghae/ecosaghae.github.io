<p>Welcome to Fort Hays State wrestling,</p>
<p>The Fort Hays State wrestling room was constructed and opened in 2007. The facility is an upgrade from the old room, which was used in the expansion of the state of the art FHSU Wellness Center which also opened in 2007.
		The wrestling room is now located at the south end of the Gross Memorial Coliseum/Cunningham Hall complex. The room replaced three intramural racquetball courts which were no longer needed, giving the program ample space for practice sessions.
